Ruby-DevIL

Ruby bindings for the Developer's Image Library
You need DevIL installed to build this extension

http://openil.sourceforge.net

It's also worth to have Ruby OpenGL bindings to use the extensions.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

For now, there is support for just a subset of DevIL functions, but it is enough
for 95% things you may want to do.

For example uses, see test/ directory
