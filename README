Ruby bindings for the Developer's Image Library
You need DevIL installed to build this extension

For debian:
* install the libdevil and libdevil-dev packages

Or go here to download the libraries:
http://openil.sourceforge.net

It's also worth having Ruby OpenGL bindings to use the extensions.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

For now, there is support for just a subset of DevIL functions, but it is enough
for 95% things you may want to do.

For example uses, see test/ directory
